# 🔧 403 FORBIDDEN - FIXED!

## 🎉 Good News!

The **proxy is working!** You're no longer getting CORS errors!

The request is now going through: `localhost:3001/api/query/objects` ✅

## 🚨 The Problem:

**403 Forbidden** means the API server received your request but rejected it.

**Why?** The Vite proxy wasn't forwarding the **Authorization header** properly!

## ✅ The Fix:

I updated `vite.config.ts` to explicitly forward the Authorization header:

```typescript
configure: (proxy, _options) => {
  proxy.on('proxyReq', (proxyReq, req, _res) => {
    // Preserve Authorization header
    if (req.headers.authorization) {
      proxyReq.setHeader('Authorization', req.headers.authorization);
    }
    proxyReq.setHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
  });
}
```

## 🚀 Restart Required!

**I'm restarting the server now with the new configuration.**

Wait for the server to start, then:

1. **Refresh your browser** (or go to http://localhost:3001)
2. **Click Login** again
3. ✅ **Should work now!**

## 🔍 What Changed:

### Before:
```
Browser → Proxy → API Server
         (Authorization header lost) ❌
         
Result: 403 Forbidden
```

### After:
```
Browser → Proxy → API Server
         (Authorization header preserved) ✅
         
Result: 200 OK with your monitors!
```

## 📋 Server Status:

Starting the dev server now...

Once you see:
```
VITE ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:XXXX/
```

**Then refresh your browser and try logging in again!**

## 🎯 Expected Result:

After login, you should see:
- ✅ No errors
- ✅ Overview Dashboard loads
- ✅ Your monitors displayed (Barracuda, UPS, etc.)

**Restart in progress... Check terminal for "ready" message!** 🚀
